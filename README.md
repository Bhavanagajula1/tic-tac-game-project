# tic-tac-game-project
he Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a simple two-player strategy game implemented using clean and modular code. The project includes both a command-line version and a browser-based UI version, allowing users to play interactively. Players take turns marking X or O on a 3×3 grid, and the game checks for winning combinations, invalid moves, and draw conditions.
